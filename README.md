# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using **Machine Learning regression techniques**.  
The model is trained on historical housing data and predicts the price of a house based on key factors such as **area, number of bedrooms, and age of the house**.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate an **end-to-end Machine Learning workflow**, starting from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and price prediction.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and apply **Supervised Machine Learning (Regression)**
- Perform data preprocessing and feature selection
- Train and evaluate a regression model
- Build a simple prediction system for real-world use
- Practice clean project structuring and Git version control

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
- **Type:** Supervised Learning  
- **Algorithm Used:** Linear Regression  
- **Evaluation Metric:** R² Score  
- **Train-Test Split:** 80% Training, 20% Testing

## 🗂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains housing-related attributes stored in a CSV file.

### Features (Input Variables):
- `area` – Size of the house (in square feet)
- `bedrooms` – Number of bedrooms
- `age` – Age of the house (in years)

### Target (Output Variable):
- `price` – House price (in Lakhs)

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. Load dataset using **Pandas**
2. Perform basic data inspection
3. Select features and target variable
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
5. Train the Linear Regression model
6. Evaluate model performance using R² Score
7. Predict house price for new user input

---

## 🧪 Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using the **R² Score**, which measures how well the predicted values match the actual values.

A higher R² score indicates better model performance.
